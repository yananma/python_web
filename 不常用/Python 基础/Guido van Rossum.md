Guido van Rossum: What programming language mean to the people who use them，如果你让一个程序员向不懂程序的人解释，typically they will say：“oh，programming language is just how you tell the computer what to do.” 然后可能会举一些具体的例子，But if that is all，if it is just a way to tell a computer what to do，why would programmers so passionate about programming language when you hear they are talking amongst themselves？So in reality，programming languages are much more than just how you tell a computer what to do，**Programming languages are how programmers express themselves and communicate ideas**。是给人看的，而不是给电脑看的。  

What is the idea of Python？Why it is so successful？How does Python distinguish itself from other programming languages？  
因为 Python is develop on the Internet，entirely in the open，by a community of volunteers who feel passion and ownership.  

I am happiest when I feel that I'm part of such a community. I'm lucky that I can feel it in my day job too。if I can't feel it，I don't feel alive。
